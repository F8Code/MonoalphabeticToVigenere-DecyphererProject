This is a project I've started in order to decypher a code written in the game Space Engineers on a stone called 'Stereolith'.
This cypher hasn't been decyphered by anyone in the community for 8 years, and this is my (for now) failed attempt at it!
All the details can be found in the .ipynb file which should be opened inside visual studio with the jupiter notebook extension.
