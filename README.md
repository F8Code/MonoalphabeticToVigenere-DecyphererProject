This is a project I've started in order to crack a code that's found in the game "Space Engineers" that's called 'Stereolith'.
This cypher hasn't been decyphered by anyone in the community for 8 years, and this is my (for now) failed attempt at it!
All the details can be found in the .ipynb file which should be opened inside visual studio with the jupiter notebook extension.
Basically this decypherer tries to bruteforce all the possible combinations of a monoalphabetical substitution,
then parsing them into a custom made Vigenere's cypher decypherer that's using different statistical analysis methods.
